<h1>Security Risk Assessment</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

📊 Overview:
  - Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment to enhance data security practices within an organization.

🔍 Key Points:
  - Assessment: Develop and document risk mitigation strategies based on audit findings (NIST SP 800-53 3.1 Media Protection family (MP-1 through MP-8) - https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf).
  - Prioritization: Objectively identify high-priority risks and effectively communicate them to the organization, fostering an informed and proactive risk management strategy.
  - Frameworks: Employed the assessment scales outlined in NIST SP 800-30 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf), providing a quantifiable framework for identifying and prioritizing risks.

🚀 Objectives:
  - Combine threat modeling results with existing Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) and System Security Plan (SSP) to understand the organization's risks.
  - Tailor risk explanations to resonate with a non-technical audience.
  - Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks.

<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>

<p align="center">
For the purpose of this project, I will be using the findings in the practical audit I conducted combined with threat modeling to understand the risks involved with the organization: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17zRvzwwiNtiXcRV9rU4kEA-JNNDUuKhEi1iBXxCatS0/edit?usp=sharing <br/>
<br />
<br />
Step 1:  <br/>
Based off NIST SP 800-53 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), my disposition was that control MP-1 (Media Protection Policy and Procedures) was not in place. <br/>

Based off the interview with Director of IT, Frank Reynolds, the review of the SOP and SSP, and the threat modeling conducted prior to the audit, I determined that the biggest risk for not having Media Protection policies and procedures in place is unauthorized access. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 2: <br/>
From the evidence I gathered in the interview, I can say that a mitigating factor for this risk is a "Tribal knowledge in place" for people within the organization. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 3:  <br/>
I then used the NIST SP 800-30 (https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) assessment scales for quantitative determination of impact and likelihood of this risk. Understanding these values allows me to consistently determine the risk for each control.

<br/>
Using these values, I can objectively determine that the likelihood of unauthorized access would be a 5 (low), and the impact if it were to happen would also be a 5 (low); the overall impact for this risk is a 25/100 (low).

<br />
<br />
Step 4:  <br/>
My objective, defensible explanation for this risk: "Staff do not know what expectations or standards are, and no process around media protection, storage or sanitization is documented, so may not be done properly. Without standards and policy, no process can be repeated consistently, and staff will develop their own individual processes." <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 5:  <br/>
After completing the risk assessment for Media Access control MP-1, I repeated steps 1-4 for controls MP-2 through MP-8.

<br/>
Step 6:  <br/>
I then sorted the spreadsheet by overall risk to prioritize the controls that have the highest risk.
<br/><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FzZVLZO.png" height="50%" width="50%" /><br/>
<br/>
Now that I had an organized list of the risks, I created an executive report to effectively communicate the risks with the organization.

<br />
<br />
Optional Step:  <br/>
The risk assessment could also include next steps to mitigate the risks in scope. Perhaps the organization I work for offers a solution to mitigate a specific risk, then I could include it in the risk assessment and add additional value for the organization. <br/>
